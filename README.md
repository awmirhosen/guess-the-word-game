# Guess the Word game

Guess the word game with react js

---

This project is one of my favorite project and itâ€™s so fun.

you have 6 attempt to find the word and if youâ€™re too hurry you can find it by inspect.

you canâ€™t enter the word that doesnâ€™t have any meaning like ghght.

you can use right word like wrong, right, hello, acrid and â€¦

if you guess the word you win ðŸ™‚

### Gray :

this word doesnâ€™t have this letter

### Yellow :

we have it but change the place :))))

### Green :

Congrats! exactly
